# Project 1 - Weather Analysis

This project analyzes historical weather data to extract meaningful insights and trends. The notebook includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and some basic statistical analysis.

# Project Structure
weather-data-analysis/
├── weather data analysis.ipynb
├── README.md
└── data/

# Features
1.Data preprocessing and cleaning
2.Summary statistics of temperature, precipitation, humidity, etc.
3.Trend analysis over time
4.Data visualization using matplotlib and/or seaborn

# Libraries Used
Python 3.x
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn

# Getting Started
1.Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/weather-data-analysis.git
cd weather-data-analysis
2.Install the dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the notebook: Open weather data analysis.ipynb using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

# Data
Make sure to place the dataset file (e.g., weather.csv) in the appropriate directory. The notebook expects a CSV file with weather-related fields like:
Date
Temperature
Humidity
Precipitation

# Insights
Some of the insights that can be derived from this analysis include:
Seasonal variations in temperature and rainfall
Frequency of extreme weather events
Correlation between humidity and precipitation

# To Do
 Add predictive modeling (e.g., linear regression or time series)
 Include more diverse weather datasets
 Make dashboard using Plotly or Streamlit
